Members of a nomadic culture might follow animal migrations or the weather, travel to sell their wares or services, or simply enjoy a restless lifestyle full of new experiences and peoples. Those who grow up in nomadic cultures learn to navigate the wilderness and work closely with others to survive.', skillGroups: ['exploration','interpersonal'], quick: 'Navigate' },
    { id: 'rural',    name: 'Rural',    desc: 'A rural culture is one located in a town, village, or smaller settled enclave. People dwelling in such places often cultivate the land, trade goods or services with travelers passing through, harvest fish from the sea, or mine metals and gems from the earth.',           skillGroups: ['crafting','lore'],           quick: 'Nature' },
    { id: 'secluded', name: 'Secluded', desc: 'A secluded culture is based in one relatively close-quarters structure—a building, a cavern, and so forth—and interacts with other cultures only rarely. Such places are often buildings or complexes such as monasteries, castles, or prisons. Folk in a secluded culture have little or no reason to leave their home or interact with other cultures on the outside, but might have an awareness of those cultures and of events happening beyond their enclave.',       skillGroups: ['interpersonal','lore'],      quick: 'Read Person' },
    { id: 'urban',    name: 'Urban',    desc: 'An urban culture is always centered in a city. Such a culture might arise within the walls of Capital, a massive metropolis with a cosmopolitan population; within a network of caverns that hold an underground city; or in any other place where a large population lives relatively close together. The people of urban cultures often learn to effectively misdirect others in order to navigate the crowds and the political machinations that can come with city life.',                     skillGroups: ['interpersonal','intrigue'],  quick: 'Alertness' },
    { id: 'wilderness',name: 'Wilderness', desc: 'A wilderness culture doesn\'t try to tame the terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest, swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their sustenance and shelter from the land. A wilderness culture might be a circle of druids protecting a remote wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the land for all they need to live, typically crafting their own tools, clothing, and more.',             skillGroups: ['crafting','exploration'],    quick: 'Endurance' },

    { id: 'bureaucratic', name: 'Bureaucratic', desc: 'Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official leadership and formally recorded laws. Members of such a culture are often ranked in power according to those laws, with a small group of people holding the power to rule according to birthright, popular vote, or some other official and measurable standard. Many bureaucratic communities', skillGroups: ['interpersonal','intrigue'], quick: 'Persuade' },
    { id: 'communal',     name: 'Communal',     desc: 'A communal culture is a place where all members of the culture are considered equal. The community works together to make important decisions that affect the majority of the culture. While they elect leaders to carry out these decisions and organize their efforts, each person has a relatively equal say in how the culture operates, and everyone contributes to help their people survive and thrive. Individuals often share the burdens of governing, physical labor, childcare, and other duties. A collective of farmers who work together to cultivate and protect their land without a noble, a city of pirates where each person can do as they wish, and a traveling theatrical troupe whose members vote on every artistic and administrative decision are all communal cultures.', skillGroups: ['crafting','exploration'], quick: 'Jump' },

People in an academic culture learn how to wield the power that is knowledge.', skillGroups: ['lore'], quick: 'History' },
    { id: 'creative', name: 'Creative', desc: 'A hero with a creative upbringing was raised among folk who create art or other works valuable enough to trade.

People in such cultures learn the value of quality crafting and attention to detail.', skillGroups: ['interpersonal','crafting'], skills: ['Music','Perform', ...DS_SKILL_GROUPS.crafting], skillLabel: 'Music / Perform or any crafting', quick: 'Perform' },
    { id: 'labor',    name: 'Labor',    desc: 'Your hero came of age in a culture where people labored for a living. They might have been cultivators, typically raising crops or livestock on a farm. They might have harvested natural resources, whether by hunting, trapping, logging, or mining. Or they might have excelled at manual labor tied to settlement and trade, such as construction, carting, loading cargo, and so forth. People with a labor upbringing know the value of hard work.', skillGroups: ['crafting','exploration','interpersonal'], skills: ['Blacksmithing','Handle Animals', ...DS_SKILL_GROUPS.exploration], skillLabel: 'Blacksmithing, Handle Animals, or any exploration', quick: 'Lift' },
    { id: 'lawless',  name: 'Lawless',  desc: 'Your hero grew up among folk who performed activities that other people—whether within or outside their culture—considered unlawful. A band of pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of spies all commit unlawful acts for money. And under tyranny, people engaged in rebellion are often considered lawless in their actions and activities. People brought up in a lawless culture typically don\'t mind breaking the rules when it suits them—and are good at making sure no one finds out they did.', skillGroups: ['intrigue'], quick: 'Sneak' },
    { id: 'martial',  name: 'Martial',  desc: 'A hero with a martial upbringing was raised by warriors. These might have been the soldiers of an established army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around combat.

Whatever the case, heroes with this background understand why the whispered words in the right ear can sometimes be more powerful than any army.', skillGroups: ['interpersonal'], quick: 'Lead' },
